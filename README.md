### Window Centre Sizer Extension for Gnome Shell
This extension builds on the the [Screenshot Window Sizer](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gnome-shell-extensions/-/tree/main/extensions/screenshot-window-sizer) extension by Florian Müllner. I've made the following minor changes to the original codebase:

- Windows are centred after being resized.
- The `[` and `]` keys are used to decrease or increase the window size.

I made this version primarily for my own use, but if you find it helpful, you’re welcome ツ.
