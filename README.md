### Window Centre Sizer Extension for Gnome Shell
This extension builds on the the [Screenshot Window Sizer](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gnome-shell-extensions/-/tree/main/extensions/screenshot-window-sizer) extension by Florian Müllner. I've made the following minor changes to the original codebase:

- Windows are now centred after being resized.
- The extension uses the `[` and `]` keys to increase or decrease the window size.

Otherwise the extension is identical. I made this version primarily for my own use but if you find it helpful, you’re welcome ツ.
